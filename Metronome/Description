This is a simple digital metronome with time signatures, Italian tempo markings, and BPMs, and allows you to locate your desired tempo quickly.

I play a bit of guitar, and need a handy metronome from time to time. There are a couple of Metronome apps out in iTune, and surprisingly none of them is free.

This is my first iPhone app, so it's by no mean fancy, and I didn't include the tuning A-440  that most digital metronomes have.
